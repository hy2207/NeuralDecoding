# Neural Decoding
1. investigate the relationship between not only single and multi-finger, but also flextion and extension movements.
2. propose a novel decoding method of modeling neural firing patterns while omitting the training process of the multi-finger movements. (propose semi-supervised decoding method)

* using MATLAB

* Presentation related to the topic were presented at the ICOIN2018 conference, and the uploaded ppt is for reference only as the PPT presented at that time. (just reference for data collection & modeling"
