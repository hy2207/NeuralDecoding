# Neural Decoding
1. investigate the relationship between not only single and multi-finger, but also flextion and extension movements.
2. propose a novel decoding method of modeling neural firing patterns while omitting the training process of the multi-finger movements. (propose semi-supervised decoding method)

* using MATLAB

Movements. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 26(12), 2240‐2248.'
